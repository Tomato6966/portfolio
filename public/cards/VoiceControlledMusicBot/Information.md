[Voice Controlled DiscordBot](https://github.com/Tomato6966/voice-controlled-discord-bot)

This Project was an amazing adventure, and used wit.ai for speech-to-text generation to control a discord bot by voice and thus play music.
You could do stuff like play / skip / stop / pause / resume without having to write the command, which is useful while gaming.

It worked by saying a keyword and then playing it
