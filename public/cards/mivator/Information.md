This Bot is the only Public Bot I made and currently work on, since i stopped working on Milrato Bot Shop (Milrato Development)

The Goal of Mivator is to provide clean, lts (long-term-support) Code which is fast and secure.

That's why it's hosted near the Discord API with sub 10ms ping.

Mivator's code base is >1400 (.ts) Files big and expands every day!
