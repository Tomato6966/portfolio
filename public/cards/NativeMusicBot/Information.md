# [Native LightMusic Bot](https://github.com/Tomato6966/light-music-bot)

This Bot is a native music bot (light music) which is blazingly fast, without any music libraries like Lavalink/distube/discord player, proofing that you can build a music bot without libs too!

This was a fun project and the first step for my voice controlled Discord Music Bot!

Additionally I made a YT-Tutorial on how to code it.
