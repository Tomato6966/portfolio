Milrato Development aka Milrato Bot Shop, was founded & created by me (Chrissy8283 aka Tomato6966). It's purpose was to offer free/cheap managed Discord Bot templates for everyone (incl. Hosting).

I worked on Milrato Development between 2019 and 2023. After that i moved on to private Projects & Commissions

Milrato Development lasted long and got quite famous. Over 45k People used the Service accross 4 Years, where it ended at around 28k active Members.

Its core was a Manager Bot, which was creating the managed hosting instances for specified Configuration, that allowed my Team to easily add hosted Bots without needing to know how the Hostingsystem works.

At Milrato we offered multiple Bot templates, which are now available on my Github.

-) Low Quality & Fast / High Quality & Mid-Fast Music Bots

-) Multipurpose Bots

-) Administration only Bots

-) Security only Bots

-) Automodertion, Antinuke & Antiraid Bots

-) Roster Systems

-) Radio Bots (24/7 Music)

-) Modmail Bots

-) Ticket Bots

-) ...and much more!


At Milrato I spent about 8-10hrs a day, which is one of the reasons why I decided to step back, when my rl started to take up most of my freetime.
